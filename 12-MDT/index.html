            A staggered keyboard is typical for many keyboards, including your
            built-in laptop keyboard. It comes from the design of the vintage
            typewriter wherein each key must avoid bumping into one another for
            smooth registration.

              <li>
                more customization options are available when using a staggered
                keyboard. Keyboard plates and foams come pre-cut to fit
                staggered keyboards more often than not.
